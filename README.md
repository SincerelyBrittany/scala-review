Everything is an object with methods available to them!

To open type `scala` into the terminal
To quit type `:q`

<br />

Variables: <br />
var - can change
`var myAge = 26` <br />
val - constant - can not change
`val myName = "Brittany"`

**_ Syntax _**

Notes:
Can use semi colons to end all statements
You can import libraries into scala by using `import scala.math._`

Case Sensitivity − Scala is case-sensitive, which means identifier Hello and hello would have different meaning in Scala.

Class Names − For all class names, the first letter should be in Upper Case. If several words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example − class MyFirstScalaClass.

Method Names − All method names should start with a Lower Case letter. If multiple words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example − def myMethodName()

Program File Name − Name of the program file should exactly match the object name. When saving the file you should save it using the object name (Remember Scala is case-sensitive) and append ‘.scala’ to the end of the name. (If the file name and the object name do not match your program will not compile).

Example − Assume 'HelloWorld' is the object name. Then the file should be saved as 'HelloWorld.scala'.

def main(args: Array[String]) − Scala program processing starts from the main() method which is a mandatory part of every Scala Program.
